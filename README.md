- NPJ888 is an online gambling platform designed for educational purposes. The
system is created to simulate a realistic casino environment but operates without real
money, making it safe and controlled. The platform is designed to provide users with an
interactive and engaging experience while exploring key functionalities of a gambling
website. Although built as an educational project, the system is versatile enough to
demonstrate how similar platforms could function in a real-world setting. The NPJ888 platform addresses several aspects of gambling website management
and user interaction. It features a comprehensive system with a home page, user login and
registration, a game selection interface, a playable game, a leaderboard, and pages for
simulated deposits and withdrawals. An admin panel is also included to provide advanced
functionality, such as user account management, game status updates, profit and loss
analysis, and analytics. The project is implemented using modern web technologies, including React,
JavaScript, and MySQL. Its focus on both the user and administrative perspectives
ensures a complete understanding of the technical and operational elements of gambling
systems. With NPJ888, the aim is to create a valuable learning experience that highlights
the key principles of ethical design and responsible development.
